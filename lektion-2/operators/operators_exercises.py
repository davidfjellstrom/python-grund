# Python Operators - Exercises
# ==========================

# 1. Arithmetic Operators
# Create two variables a = 8, b = 3
# Perform and print the result of:
# addition, subtraction, multiplication, division,
# floor division, modulus, exponentiation


# 2. Comparison Operators
# Create two variables a = 7, b = 10
# Print the result of:
# a > b
# a < b
# a == b
# a != b
# a >= b
# a <= b


# 3. Logical Operators
# Create two boolean variables a = True, b = False
# Print the result of:
# a and b
# a or b
# not a


# 4. Assignment Operators
# Create a variable a = 5
# Use assignment operators to perform:
# - b = a
# - b += a
# - b -= a
# - b *= a
# Print the value of b after each operation


# 5. Identity Operators
# Create variables a = 10, b = 20, c = a
# Print the result of:
# a is b
# a is not b
# a is c
# a is not c


# 6. Membership Operators
# Create a list: my_list = [5, 10, 15, 20]
# Create two variables x = 25, y = 10
# Check and print whether x is in my_list
# Check and print whether y is in my_list
